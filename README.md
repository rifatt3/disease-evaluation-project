# disease-evaluation-project
My final project in university. Heart disease, brain tumor, breast cancer prediction using machine and deep learning models, packed within an UI.  

1) Heart disease rate prediction using behaviour patterns of an individual.
2) Brain tumor classification using MR images.
3) Breast cancer classification using description values of a potential cancer node as independent parameters (input) and retrieving the dependent solution as malicious or benign.
